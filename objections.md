# Objections

## money == power
Yes. Some. In this system the only way to excersize that power is by paying some of that money to other people, and in the case of direct self promotion or suppressing others, by paying everybody.  There are distinct limits to the ability of money to command eyeballs on this system, probably to the point that the money is better spent elsewhere for the desired gains.
If a sufficiently moneyed individual were to impose heavily on rankings and annoy people the result would be an overall richer community who would avail themselves of the available feed filtering tools to ignore them and perhaps pay special attention to anybody who was suppressed by them.
A crude solution would be to ignore all self promoters or just the aggressive ones.  Though the self promotion feature is generally a fairly noble way to highlight a post you're partuicularly proud of by thowing some coin in the common.

#### But a cartel could circumvent the self promotion contribution by pipping each other.
Yes. But all transaction information is public.  It would only take one person digging to identify the shenanigans and make it known.  Such ignoble attempts at unfairness will probably be widely frowned upon. A user generated feed filter that hides all known cases might become popular.  Not all cases of apparent reciprocal pipping would be sinister though.  A pair of friends who regularly appreciate each others posts might agree to tone down the pip payments, or just use their words.

A simple algorithm at the system level may be warranted to divert a percentage of reciprocal payments to the common or damp the ranking factor, or both, but only if it's truly worth the complexity and maybe only if anti-cartel filters become widely depended on.
