# Objections

## money == power
Yes. Some. In this system the only way to excersize that power is by paying some of that money to other people, and in the case of direct self promotion or suppressing others, by paying everybody.  There are distinct limits to the ability of money to command eyeballs on this system, probably to the point that the money is better spent elsewhere for the desired gains.

If a sufficiently moneyed individual were to impose heavily on rankings and annoy people the result would be an overall richer community who would avail themselves of the available feed filtering tools to ignore them and perhaps pay special attention to anybody who was suppressed by them.

A crude solution would be to ignore all self promoters or just the aggressive ones.  Though the self promotion feature is generally a fairly noble way to highlight a post you're particularly proud of by thowing some coin in the common.

#### But a cartel could circumvent the self promotion contribution by pipping each other.
Yes. But all transaction information is public.  It would only take one person digging to identify the shenanigans and make it known.  Such ignoble attempts at unfairness will probably be widely frowned upon. A user generated feed filter that hides all known cases might become popular.  Not all cases of apparent reciprocal pipping would be sinister though.  A pair of friends who regularly appreciate each other's posts might agree to tone down the pip payments, or just use their words.

A simple algorithm at the system level may be warranted to divert a percentage of reciprocal payments to the common or damp the ranking factor, or both, but only if it's truly worth the complexity and maybe only if anti-cartel filters become widely depended on.

#### The other end of the stick.
The upside for the big spending participants is quite limited compared to the downside.  Now consider the least moneyed participants. The potential upside from a well placed insightful post is relatively open.

## Unregulated, unmoderated, unbearable!
How indeed will people behave in the abscence of clear authority?  Hopefully better than some would presume. Lack of singular authority doesn't mean lack of regulation or moderation, mind.  Every participant wields partial authority and the means to award merit and consequence. Conventions will emerge, some obvious, maybe some novel, some strict, some loose.  Currently implemented unmoderated forums frequently trend towards antisocial environments but the hope is that anchoring a reward system in tangible value will give rationality and real merit room to flourish.

#### But what about the truly vile?
There's a button for that, called kip.  It's a little bit of shoosh (or a lot) that you can wield on behalf of everybody when the occasion warrants it.  You will need to pay the common in proportion to how heavily you wield it, and if done wisely people might be doubly grateful.  You could also just filter out potential vileness as you see fit.

#### But but criminally vile?
Report criminal activity to the geographically relevant civil authority.  The forum management will comply with court orders in the jurisdictions it is subject to.

If the offender is in a juridiction that doesn't find the post prosecutable maybe enough people will be equally willing to suppress the offensive item out of sight for everyone except those who definitely don't mind seeing it.

#### Now that's just herding vileness into hidden cliques.
Agreed. Other approaches are available here. Maybe some kind words and even a pip on one of the poster's non-vile posts will illuminate a path away from vileness?  At some point it may be neccessary to accept that some vileness will always exist and carry on regardless.  You can't win em all.
