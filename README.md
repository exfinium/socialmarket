# social market

Market regulated social network project.

## Principles
### Meaningful communication
Humans are generally more thoughtful and intentional when the stakes are tangible. By requiring interactions in a public forum to be backed by tangible value the hope is to facilitate more meaningful communication.
### Spontaneous order
Provide a place for people to communicate and reward the communication of others and various patterns of talent and cooperation will emerge.  If that place is devoid of arbitrary external regulation it will nevertheless become regulated by the sorting of the values of the participants. 
### True proximal price
Everything has a cost, a value, and a price.  Many things seem free because the actual cost is hidden elsewhere.  A system that works to reveal all costs immediately and proximally provides the best foundation for rationally sorting values.
* nothing is free
### Secrets impede trust
Secrets are important to people for various reasons.  This project will honour participants dignity by clearly and loudly declaring this place as devoid of any safe spaces for secrets.  It is unapolagetically and completely public.
### Pure universality
Every participant and every idea has equal opportunity and no person, group or idea will be granted privelage or penalty by the system itself.
### Positive credit
The system does not allow the taking of credit - only the giving of it.  Negative feedback exists but when you pay to disaprove of a post the payemnt goes to the commons and lifts everyone's balance.  Paying to approve of your own posts does the same.

## Technology
### Microtransactions
To facilitate frequent proximal frictionless exchanges of value with sufficently minimal overhead requires the implementation of a grade separated currency, similar in principle to tradable currecies found in many persistent computer game worlds.
### Floating exchange rate
Value tokens within the system will not be pinned to any real world currency and will instead be regularly or constantly adjusted to follow the mean transaction value.  Account balances will be accounted as a share of total capitalisation of the market.
