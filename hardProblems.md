# hard problems
## legal compliance
### mass surveilance
* no secrets: firehose feed is available to all who can pay for it
* policy of loud resistance to totalitarian imposition
### illegal content
* court ordered removal referred to the user?
* international infrastructure
* connected national branches facilitating national censorship?
* clear demarcation of censor jurisdictions in effect
* policy of reluctant, minimal cooperation
* vacation of juridictions with onerous obligations
## financial compliance
### accountability
* maintain full reserve to liquidate all accounts
* floating token value needs to be clearly communicated
### money laundering
* no secrets: deals may be hidden in the mass but are nontheless publicly visible
* no limits on cash-in/cash-out and internal transactions

## everything else is free
Show me something that is truly free and I will show you something that is truly meaningless.
### expectation jolt
### made possible by microtransactions


## profitability
### competition
* competitors who attempt to differentiate with regulatory oversight will incur greater overheads
* no secrets: anyone will be able to see all financial details and copy the formula
* market pressure will drive down house percentages
* infrastructure efficiency and user experience will be the keys to long term profitability
### scale
* there will be temptations to compromise in order to achieve greater scale
### cooperation
* there will be opportunities to integrate complementary services/technologies
* userpay: complementary tech whether in-house or partnered should be separately encapsulated/priced
